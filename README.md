At least half of the Earth's Oxygen comes from the ocean( National Ocean Service). About 10 million metric tons of plastic waste, which makes up 80% of all marine pollution, enter the oceans yearly, killing seabirds, fish, and marine mammals. It breaks down into smaller pieces called microplastics that absorb various chemicals floating in the marine environment, including pesticides and toxic metals. Research states that, by 2050, plastic will likely outweigh all fish in the sea.

The ocean is the primary source of protein for more than a billion people worldwide, contributing at least 50% of the planet's oxygen production and housing the majority of its biodiversity. Not to mention, our economy depends heavily on the ocean, with 40 million people expected to work in industries related to the ocean by 2030.

Over 200 million Africans and more than 2 million of the Kenyan population are currently employed in the fishing sector.
Despite its significance, the ocean now needs help.

Description of the project
_____________________
AquaViva is an IoT-based project that aims to preserve marine life and balance the ecosystem along the Kenyan coastal strip in order to improve food security as well as mitigate the effects of climate change.
80% of all the plastics end up in the ocean via rivers. This project focuses on trapping and collecting plastics in rivers before they reach the ocean.
