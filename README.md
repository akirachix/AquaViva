At least half of the Earth's Oxygen comes from the ocean( National Ocean Service).
The Ocean is a source of protein/food to over 200 million to Africans and more than 2 million of the Kenyan population are employed in the fishing sector.

Plastic waste makes up 80% of all marine pollution and around 8 to 10 million metric tons of plastic end up in the ocean each year. Research states that, by 2050, plastic will likely outweigh all fish in the sea. 

Description
___________

AquaViva is an IoT-based project that aims to preserve marine life and balance the ecosystem along the Kenyan coastal strip in order to improve food security and mitigate the effects of climate change.

80% of all the plastics end up in the ocean via rivers. This project focuses on trapping and collecting plastics in rivers before they reach the ocean
since they are the lead cause of decline and imbalance in the marine ecosystem.
